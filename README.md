# Responsive design template

This repository serves as a general reference for writing responsive and accessible websites in Sass with the BEM methodology. This repository has examples of:

- Writing efficient, modular and maintainable styles with BEM, Sass partials, mixins, CSS custom properties and helper/utility classes.
- Using appropriate semantic HTML tags.
- Appropriate use of CSS units including `px`, `em`, `rem`, `ch`, `%` and `vw`.
- Mapping out colour themes with CSS custom properties.
- Fluid typography with the `clamp()` function, as described in [Modern Fluid Typography with clamp()](https://chriskirknielsen.com/blog/modern-fluid-typography-with-clamp/), by Christopher Kirk-Nielsen.
- Use of SVGs to create scalable and acessible images.
- Compiling Sass with Vite for use with frameworks.
